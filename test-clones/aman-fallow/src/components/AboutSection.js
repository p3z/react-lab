            <p className = "about-section__body">Aman was nominated a Woofus award for his critically acclaimed first novel Follow Suit in March 2007. Since then he has had a string of successes with A Bird Came Calling, A World Away, and Unravelling Entropy.</p>
            <p className = "about-section__body">His latest book, A Chronicle of Entropy is due to be released in December 2018 and is a sequel to Unravelling Entropy.</p>
            <p className = "about-section__body">Aman studied for nine years at Perriwinkle academy, and since then has allowed his interest in spacetime and romance to colour the backdrop of his writing style.</p>
            <p className = "about-section__body">Born beneath a full moon at sea to Elizabeth and Roy Fallow, Aman has always preferred the serenity of a boat in the ocean to living inland.
